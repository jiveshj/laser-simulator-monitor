Suggested Assembly/Test Order:

0.  Check with meter, ensure open circuit between 12V and GND, 5V and GND

1.  Install all passives (R, C, LEDs)
    NOTE:  LED install with long lead in round pad hole

2.  Install U3

3.  Connect power supply to J4 (observe polarity, it is not marked!)
    Apply 12V power with 100mA current limit.

    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________

	    5V1 LED lit
    	    12V1 LED lit
    	    +5V measures correct with meter
	    +12V measures correct with meter
	    Check 5V and 12V on power supply pins of all chips

4.  Install socket and Arduino
    Apply 12V power
    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________
    	    Power LEDs still lit

5.  Install Aruino software
    Connect USB cable
    Set for board "Arduino Leonardo"
    Figure out port if needed

    Load "blinky" example and change to pin 14 where LED1 is connected

    Download and run, LED1 should blink.

    You should be very happy at this point!  The Arduino is working!



6.  Install U1

    Apply 12V power
    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________
    	    Power LEDs still lit

    At this point we need some software

    Install the MCP342x library and get some of the examples working.

    Connect a 1k-10k potentiometer as follows:

    	    Top    - 5V
	    wiper  - ADC0 (J3 pin 1)
	    Bottom - GND

    Read the ADC channel 0 while you adjust the pot.
    Make a plot of ADC reading vs voltage, should be linear.

7.  Install U5, U8

    Apply 12V power
    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________
    	    Power LEDs still lit

    Check with your pot connected to ADC4 and ADC8 that they work as well

8.  Install U7

    Apply 12V power
    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________
    	    Power LEDs still lit

    Find and install the Arduino library for the digi pot (MCP4561)

    Test it:  changing the setting should change the voltage on pin 6 (or pin 3 of U4)

9.  Install U2

    Apply 12V power
    check:  Note power supply current:  ____________________
    	    Power LEDs still lit

    Test U2.  It is designed to measure current in the 0-1A range or so.
    Use ohm's law to choose a resistor to connect between RT0 and GND, read ADC9
    (or check the voltage at ADC9 with a meter) and confirm that it works as expected.



10. Install U4.

    Using your test resistor from step 9 and software to program the digi pot,
    measure the output of U4 (pin 7) and ensure that it works as expected.

11. Install U6.

    Test the logic.  When either pin 1 or pin 2 is high on U6, pin 3 should be high.

    (pin 1 is output of U4, pin 2 is Arduino D5)

12. Install Q1

    Connect a resistor (maybe with an LED) on J2

    Confirm that everything works correctly
    (current limit set with digi pot, enable with Arduino pin D5)

That's pretty much it for the hardware.

For the software, see ...Software/Arduino/SerialCommandExample
and the README in the Software directory to get started.
